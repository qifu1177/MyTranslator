The translation software has been designed to be able to capture text from various sources, be it printed documents, screen views or other visual information. Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text is extracted from the snapshots and then translated into the desired target languages.

The software is designed to help businesses and individuals efficiently and accurately translate content that is in visual form. We have taken care to ensure that the translation accuracy meets our high standards while respecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information transmitted.
